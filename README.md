# **Wildlife Species Location Prediction System**  

## **📌 Overview**  
The **Wildlife Species Location Prediction System** is a **machine learning-based application** designed to predict the future locations of wildlife species based on **historical GPS tracking data and environmental factors**. By leveraging the **Random Forest Regressor**, this system provides accurate predictions, helping conservationists and researchers analyze wildlife movement patterns and make data-driven decisions.  

## **🚀 Features**  
✅ **CSV Data Upload** – Upload wildlife movement datasets for analysis.  
✅ **Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering** – Handles missing values, encodes categorical features, and extracts temporal/environmental factors.  
✅ **Machine Learning Model** – Predicts future **latitude and longitude** using a trained **Random Forest Regressor**.  
✅ **Feature Importance Analysis** – Identifies key factors influencing wildlife movement.  
✅ **Interactive Visualizations** – Displays **historical movement patterns, feature distributions, and predicted locations** using Folium maps and Matplotlib.  
✅ **Model Performance Metrics** – Evaluates prediction accuracy with **Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R² score**.  

## **🛠 Tech Stack**  
- **Frontend:** Streamlit  
- **Backend:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn)  
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn, Folium  
- **Machine Learning Model:** Random Forest Regressor

## **⚙️ Installation & Usage**  

### **1️⃣ Clone the Repository**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Wildlife-Species-Location-Prediction.git
cd Wildlife-Species-Location-Prediction
```

### **2️⃣ Install Dependencies**  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **3️⃣ Run the Application**  
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## **📊 Data Format**  
The dataset should be in **CSV format** with columns such as:  
```
Timestamp, Latitude, Longitude, Weather, Temperature, Food_Offered, Health_Condition
```
Ensure the dataset contains relevant **temporal and ecological factors** for accurate predictions.  

## **📈 Model Performance**  
- **Latitude Prediction:** MAE = **0.00994**, R² = **0.642**  
- **Longitude Prediction:** MAE = **0.00863**, R² = **-0.278**  
- Performance may improve with additional environmental variables and refined model tuning.  

## **🔮 Future Enhancements**  
✔ **Expand to Multiple Wildlife Species** – Extend the model for other species.  
✔ **Integrate Real-time GPS Data** – Enable real-time tracking and predictions.  
✔ **Improve Feature Engineering** – Incorporate more ecological parameters for better accuracy.  
✔ **Enhance Model Performance** – Experiment with other ML algorithms (e.g., XGBoost, LSTMs).
